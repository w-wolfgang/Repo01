## Week 1 - History and Intro
- Mid term weigth 25%
- Sumerian clay tablets of 5000 years ago hold the oldest known writing
- "cuneiform" the impressionist writing technique stands for wedge shaped in Latin

## Week 2 - Bits and Bytes
- The bit is limited to 2 states 0 and 1 or true and false
- A byte is 8 bits
- Storage or disk for longterm memory
- RAM for volatile working memory
- Computers see memory as one long sequence of bytes. It can look up the value in each one of the bytes
- Text Files: Interpreted as characters using ASCII.
Binary Files: Not intended to be read as text.

## Week 3 - Markup Languages 
- Alphanumeric characters – letters and digits
like A, b, c … and 0 to 9
- Non-alphanumeric characters are everything else – Examples: {[(+)]};-) 
sometimes shortened as non-alpha
- The term markup comes from proofreading 'markup' on newspapers
- Computer markup language provides instructions on how to display and interpret text

## Week 4 - Keyboards & Editors 
- qwerty is the most common keyboard layout
- A modifier key modifies the normal action of another key

⇧ Shift  
⌃ Ctrl  –  Control
⎇ Alt  –  Alternate – also labelled ⌥ Option on Apple keyboards.
⌘ Cmd – Command key on Apple keyboards
⊞ Win  –  Windows logo on Windows keyboards

Fn (Function) – used on small-layout keyboards, or keyboard where the top row of keys F1-F12 have multimedia functions like controlling audio volume
- Touch typing is typing without looking at the keyboard
- Notepad is a text editor these tools don’t allow rich formatting and show each character in the file as a character on the screen

## Week 5 - CLI/Command Line Interfaces 
- Starting the terminal - MacOS – Spotlight: Terminal
Windows – Win key -> Terminal
Or WSL – Windows Subsystem for Linux – a Linux VM running alongside Windows
- Why use CLI today?: Some functionality has no GUI
Precise control
Easy automation of repetitive tasks (scripting)
Faster - for some types of work
Works great remotely over slow networks
Requires very little computer resources compared to GUI
- Some useful commands: ls – list files in current directory
pwd – print working directory
cd - change directory
cat, less – show contents of a text file
cp, mv, mkdir – copy & move files, create a directory
ping – ping a server over the network
- ssh my.server.com
Command line is great for working remotely – only short pieces of text are sent over the network 
ssh my.server.com, the commands you type are addressed to that computer
